A simple [E:D Market Connector][EDMC] plugin to automatically collect data for EDAstro.com that
cannot be sourced from major databases such as Spansh and EDDN.

### Credit
This code is almost entirely derived from the original [ATEL-EDMC] plugin with
the IGAU components stripped out. As this is no longer maintained and there is
still a community need to submit relevant data to EDAstro, I have revived that
portion of the plugin.
